# How to contribute

Thanks for considering to contribute to JSON Patch for PHP! Just follow these single guidelines:
- You must follow the PSR-2 coding standard. More info [here](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md). With these tweaks:
    - Always use spaces!
    - Ensure the coding standard compliance before committing or opening pull requests by running `php-cs-fixer fix .` or `composer cs-fix` in the root directory of this repository.
- You must use [feature / topic branches](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows) to ease the merge of contributions.
